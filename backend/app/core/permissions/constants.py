Permission constants for the application.

Each class represents a resource and defines its available permissions.
Use these constants in your route dependencies instead of hardcoded strings.

Example:
    from app.core.permissions.constants import Permissions as P

    @router.post("/", dependencies=[Depends(permissions(P.ApiKey.CREATE))])
    async def create_api_key(...):
        ...
