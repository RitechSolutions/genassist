    """Create ReAct system prompt when tools are available"""

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{chr(10).join(tool_descriptions)}

REACT REASONING PATTERN:
Follow this exact reasoning pattern for each step:

1. **Thought**: Think about what you need to do and what information you have
2. **Action**: Choose a tool to use, or "none" if no tool is needed
3. **Action Input**: Provide the parameters for the tool in JSON format
4. **Observation**: [This will be filled automatically with tool results]

Continue this pattern until you can provide a Final Answer.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Use this exact format for each reasoning step:

```
Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [tool_name or "none"]
Action Input: {{"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}}
```

When you have enough information to answer the user's question, provide:
```
Final Answer: [Your complete response to the user]
```

GUIDELINES:
- Always include your reasoning in the Thought section
- Pay attention to required parameters - all required parameters must be provided
- Use tools when they can provide more accurate or up-to-date information
- If a tool fails, analyze the error and try a different approach
- Provide clear and comprehensive Final Answers

AVAILABLE TOOLS:

TOOL USAGE GUIDELINES:
- Always consider which tools are available before responding
- Use tools when they can provide more accurate, up-to-date, or comprehensive information
- Pay attention to required parameters - all required parameters must be provided
- If a parameter has a default value, you can omit it from the tool call
- If multiple tools could be useful, consider using them in sequence
- Always explain your tool selection reasoning and parameter choices
- If a tool fails due to missing or invalid parameters, check the parameter requirements
- Provide clear summaries of tool results to the user

TOOL CALL FORMAT:
When you need to use a tool, respond with a JSON object in this exact format:

        "param1": "value1",
