        contains a list of objects as a dict where each one has these fields:
                            - "text": The spoken sentence.
                            - "start_time": The start time of that part of the conversation.
                            - "end_time": The end time of that part of the conversation.
        
                            Your task is to take the items and separate them into an array of JSON objects where 
                            based on context you assign if the speaker is the agent or the customer.
                            Each object should have:
                            - "text": The spoken sentence.
                            - "speaker": Either "Customer" or "Agent".

                            If the speaker doesn't change for two consecutive objects, they should be in one object.
                            If from context it is evident that there is are wrong words in the transcription you are 
                            allowed to modify them.
