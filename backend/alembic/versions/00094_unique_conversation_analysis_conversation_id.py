"""unique_conversation_analysis_conversation_id

Enforce one analysis row per conversation.

A conversation could previously accumulate multiple ``conversation_analysis``
rows because every write went through a plain INSERT with no DB uniqueness
(migration 00091 added only a *non-unique* index on ``conversation_id``). This
migration:
  1. de-duplicates existing rows, keeping the most recent analysis per
     conversation (by ``created_at``, then ``id``),
  2. drops the now-superseded non-unique index, and
  3. adds a UNIQUE constraint on ``conversation_id`` so re-analysis can only
     replace the existing row, never add another.
